excerpt: 'This Master thesis by EmmaÂ Ahrens presents a detailed study of discrete-time flows over time, introducing generalized temporally repeated flows for quickest transshipment and related problems. It defines network flow models with transit times and costs, explores temporally repeated, uniform, and k-uniform flows, and establishes integer properties, reductions, and algorithms, with a focus on tree-structured networks.'
