excerpt: 'This Bachelor thesis investigates standard generators for finite classical groups, particularly focusing on black-box representations in computational group theory. It presents criteria for recognizing and constructing standard generators and studies their existence and structure in key families such as $$\mathrm{SL}(n,q)$$ and $$\mathrm{Sp}(2n,q)$$. The results support algorithmic identification and handling of classical groups in the black-box setting and connect theoretical properties with computational feasibility.'
