excerpt: 'This paper presents a Hoare-style calculus for formal reasoning about reconfiguration programs of distributed
systems. Such programs create and delete components and/or interactions (connectors) while the system
components change state according to their internal behaviour. Our proof calculus uses a resource logic, in
the spirit of Separation Logic, to give local specifications of reconfiguration actions. Moreover, distributed
systems with an unbounded number of components are described using inductively defined predicates. The
correctness of reconfiguration programs relies on havoc invariants, that are assertions about the ongoing
interactions in a part of the system that is not affected by the structural change caused by the reconfiguration.
We present a proof system for such invariants in an assume/rely-guarantee style. We illustrate the feasibility
of our approach by proving the correctness of real-life distributed systems with reconfigurable (self-adjustable)
tree architectures.'
