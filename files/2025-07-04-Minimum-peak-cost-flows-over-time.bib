  abstract  = "ABSTRACTPeak cost is a novel objective for flows over time that
               describes the amount of workforce necessary to run a system. We
               focus on minimizing peak costs in the context of maximum
               temporally repeated flows and formulate the corresponding
               MPC‐MTRF problem. First, we discuss the limitations that emerge
               when restricting the solution space to integral temporally
               repeated flows, which is motivated by practical applications. We
               show that, in general, MPC‐MTRF has an integrality gap of and an
               arbitrarily bad approximation ratio compared to general flows
               over time. We proceed with a complexity analysis for MPC‐MTRF
               and show that both the decision version and the optimization
               version of integral MPC‐MTRF are strongly ‐hard, even under
               strong restrictions. On the positive side, we identify two
               special cases that are solvable in polynomial time: unit‐cost
               series‐parallel networks and networks with time horizon at least
               twice as long as the longest path in the network with respect to
               the transit time. Moreover, in both cases, we provide an
               explicit algorithm that constructs an integral optimal solution.",
