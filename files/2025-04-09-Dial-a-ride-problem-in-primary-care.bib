  abstract  = "Abstract Patient transportation systems are instrumental in
               lowering access barriers in primary care by taking patients to
               their general practitioners (GPs). However, the economic
               sustainability of such transportation systems based on ride
               sharing strongly depends on how well transportation requests can
               be bundled. We consider a dial-a-ride setting where the
               transportation requests consist of a ride to the GP and back.
               Patients may be chronic or ``walk-in'' patients, with the latter
               requiring transportation on short notice. In the general
               setting, the GPs fix appointments without consideration of the
               transportation. In our flexible scheduling setting, for chronic
               patients only an appointment range is fixed a priori, and the
               exact time is determined when the vehicle routes are computed.
               To tackle this setting, we propose a novel extension of the
               dial-a-ride problem, the dial-a-ride problem with combined
               requests and flexible scheduling (DARPCF). We introduce a
               heuristic for the DARPCF, called MCLIH, that is designed to
               exploit this increased flexibility. Initially, MCLIH computes
               so-called mini-clusters of outbound requests. Then, the
               mini-clusters are linked by solving a traveling salesman problem
               and creating routes of outbound rides with a splitting
               procedure. Our computational study shows that in rural regions
               with MCLIH and the flexible scheduling of chronic appointments,
               the average number of served transportation requests can be
               increased by $$38\%$$ 38 \% compared to a non-flexible setting.",
